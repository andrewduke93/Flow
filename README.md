# Flow — The Next‑Gen Speed‑Reading App

Welcome to **Flow** — a modern, open-source speed-reading platform for focus, comprehension, and enjoyment. Flow pairs a grammar-aware RSVP engine with a virtualized reader, strong accessibility defaults, and a PWA-ready UI so you can read faster on any device.

Highlights
- Grammar-aware RSVP teleprompter with natural pauses and a focus reticle
- Virtualization for instant rendering of very large books
- Custom themes, cloud sync (optional), and PWA installability

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andrewduke93/Flow.git
   cd Flow/Flow-main
   npm install
   ```
2. Run locally:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📚 How It Works

- **RSVP Engine**: Breaks text into tokens, applies grammar-aware timing, and presents each word at the optimal moment.
- **Virtualization**: Only renders what you see, so even huge books are instant and smooth.
- **Customizable**: Change speed, font, theme, and more — all in real time.
- **Cloud & Local Storage**: Your books and progress are always safe.
